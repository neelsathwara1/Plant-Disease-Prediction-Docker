# Plant-Disease-Prediction-Docker
This project leverages Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Streamlit, and Docker to create a user-friendly web application that predicts plant diseases from images of plant leaves. The model helps farmers and agricultural experts detect diseases at an early stage, improving crop management and yield.
